## Education in India should be skill-based rather than qualification-based

# Introduction 

In India, People still evaluated education in terms of diplomas and degrees. Even companies in India require you to have at least a bachelor's or a master's degree for most roles. But nowadays remote work culture is on the rise and people are preferring working for startups rather than working for an MNC. In startups, the team size is smaller compared to big companies thus hiring process is way less rigorous and mainly the interviews are taken by the founders of the company. The startup founders are mainly students or students who have dropped out of their universities or students who took their passion more seriously than their regular university studies and grades, thus they mainly focus on skills more than any grades or degrees. Candidates with a diverse portfolio and with a lot of skills bags a well-paying offer which is often way more than what an established company offers. 

# The Problem 

The majority of youth who are recent freshers in the industry are unable to withstand the pressure of a highly challenging and competitive field, the only reason is all they did in their college life is study like they used to in school and never gained any practical experience. Folks in India does internship not to gain any value but to earn that certificate that comes with it so that they can get the required credit to pass out. The fault is in the old curriculum in our universities designed to cater only for employees, not leaders. Skill development is becoming so important that students are buying courses on coding, design, digital marketing etc from many marketplaces and ed-tech companies for lakh of rupees while doing a degree where they are paying hefty fees but not attending the classes. To solve this education institutions must develop skill development centres to fill the gap between industry and academic life, it would help the fresher students who will be ready for the everyday challenges in corporate life and become multi-talented. Skill-based education is very much essential for student growth. Qualifications and skills should work together hand-in-hand to enhance an individual. Skill development doesn't only strengthens an individual it also strengthens a nation passively. Most of the unemployed are lacking practical knowledge and that happens when your degree lacks skills. A student must be assessed in terms of various and wide subjects, the most important subject of all are skills which define your role in any organisation.

# Solutions 

The New Education Policy has come up with a skill-based model of education. This has made vocational courses more important which seek to make folks more skilful and independent. Education must be the change for good. National education policy gave a thought and now designing a system which is more dynamic and robust which gives a student freedom to choose the skills they want to improve or learn. Unemployment is a huge problem in India and it's high time that we focus on skill-based learning which prepares students for what's coming after their degree. 

Skill-based education is flexible, which gives a student room to breathe and the whole structure of a studentâ€™s education depends on them rather than pre-decided by a university or a college. Students check their progress with the help of assessments and hands-on projects.

# Learning
